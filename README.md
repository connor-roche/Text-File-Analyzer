# Text-File-Analyzer

The program reads in text files and determines information about the longest word and longest line in each file.

The program recognizes multiple optional flags that the user can use to get more specific data:

-m when printing the longest word in the file, print only the longest words that appear the most often

-c in addition to printing the longest words and the length of the longest line, include, in parenthesis, a count of the number   of times that the word/line appears

-b consider multiple blanks between words on a line as a single blank for the purpose of calculating the length of a line
